The Binary Tree Visualizer is a web-based tool designed to provide an interactive and intuitive way to understand binary tree structures. This project leverages HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a visual representation of binary trees, max-heaps, and binary search trees.

Key Features:

Interactive Visualization: Users can input arrays and visualize them as binary trees or heaps. 
The visualization dynamically updates based on user input.

Binary Search Tree Creation: Automatically converts sorted input data into a binary search tree for easy understanding.

Max-Heap Visualization: Transforms input arrays into max-heaps, displaying the heap properties clearly.
User Engagement: Enhanced user experience with features like node highlighting, animated tree operations, and informative tooltips.
Responsive Design: The visualizer is built with a responsive layout, ensuring usability across different devices and screen sizes.
